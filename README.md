# FlashCards App

## Introduction
A FlashCard is a little card where we put a question on the face and the answer on the back...

This learning method is very efficient... (for example with historical dates).
The goal of this app is to let user create cards where he can put questions and answers to learn them after...

## Demo
The [demo](https://flashcards-app-1f705.web.app/) (hosted on Firebase). 

## Technologies
The project is mainly built with **React** (+ **React Router**, **Redux**), **Firebase** (and **SCSS**).

**Other important libraries:**
- **React-icons** for icons (Ionic icons are used).
- **Rc-tree** for folder tree view.
- **React-toastify** for toast notifications.
- **React-transition-group** for animations.
- etc.

## Roadmap
- Create the learning page where the user can learn cards he has created.
- Improve UI/UX.
- Create a Backend (for the moment, Firebase is used).
- And a lot more (it's just the beginning...).
