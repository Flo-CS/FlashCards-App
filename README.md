# FlashCards App

## Introduction
A FlashCard is a little card where we write a question on the front and the answer on the back...

This learning method is very efficient... (with historical dates for example).
The goal of this app is to let user create cards where he can write questions and answers to learn them after...

## Demo
The [demo](https://flashcards-app-1f705.web.app/) (hosted on Firebase). 

## Technologies
The project is mainly built with **React** (+ **React Router**, **Redux**), **Firebase** (and **SCSS**).

**Other important libraries:**
- **React-icons** for icons (Ionic icons are used).
- **Rc-tree** for folder tree view.
- **React-toastify** for toast notifications.
- **React-transition-group** for animations.
- etc.

## Roadmap
- Implement SearchBar.
- Create the learning page where the user can learn cards he created.
- Improve UI/UX.
- Create "a true Backend" (for the moment Firebase is used).
- Optimize performance.
